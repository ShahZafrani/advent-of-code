# 2022 AoC Journal

## Days 1 and 2:
I started these a week late and decided to use dotnet 7 as a means to help get more comfortable with the tech I'm supposed to use at MSFT.

## Day 3:
I have decided to a class based approach.

## Day 4:
I am creating a template to use in the dotnet cli so that I can generate a Solver Implementation with methods already in place to read in puzzle input and solve parts 1 and 2. The goal is to have a Solver Interface with methods that need to be implemented. 

tutorial followed: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/cli-templates-create-item-template 
The /test and /working folders are used for the extensions. 

-- Giving up on interface for now since I have no wifi to look things up.
